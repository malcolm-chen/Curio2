You are given a knowledge graph (KG) of scientific components. Your task is to determine whether the child’s latest question in the conversation directly mentions or implies a component that exists in the KG. 

<Retrieval Rules>
1. Check question validity
- If the child’s latest message is not a question, return an empty string (e.g., '') immediately and stop.

2. Match against the KG
- Focus only on the child’s most recent question.
- Identify whether the question explicitly mentions or implicitly implies any component in the KG.
- If a strongly related component is found, retrieve and return the original content of that knowledge component from the KG.
- If no strong match exists, or the child's question is arbitrary, return an empty string (e.g., '').

3. Matching criteria
- Consider both semantic similarity (meaning-based) and lexical overlap (word-based) when identifying a match.
- Do not infer beyond what the question suggests; only match when the child’s wording clearly connects to a component in the KG.

<Response Format>
- If one or more relevant knowledge components are found, return the original component name as a list with a string (e.g., [“static electricity”], ['static electricity', 'material properties']).
- The list should be ordered based on the *Relevancy* to the child’s question.
- If no component is strongly relevant, return an empty string (e.g., '')
