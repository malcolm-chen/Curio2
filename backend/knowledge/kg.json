  "Hair stands up near a balloon": {
   "mechanism": "When the child rubs a balloon on her fleece sweater, the rubbing gives energy to tiny negative charges called electrons, making them move from the fleece onto the balloon. This movement builds up static electricity, leaving the balloon with extra electrons (a negative charge) and the sweater with fewer (a positive charge). When the charged balloon is brought near the child’s hair, it pulls on the hair without touching it. Each strand of hair also carries a similar charge, so the hairs push away from one another and spread out like a spiky crown. Fleece helps this happen because it easily lets electrons move, while cotton does not. Children can test when static electricity happens and how strong it is by changing the material, the number of rubs, how close the balloon is to the hair, or their own creative ideas.",

This can happen when objects rub, touch, or even come close together. When this build-up occurs, one object can gain extra charge and the other lose some, creating an invisible push or pull between them.",
        "explanation": "When the child rubs the balloon on her fleece sweater, tiny negative charges called electrons move from the sweater onto the balloon. This movement builds up static electricity, leaving the balloon charged and ready to pull on her hair without touching. The sibling’s cotton shirt doesn’t move many electrons to the balloon, so it doesn’t build up much static electricity.",

Cotton is a natural fiber that does not transfer electrons as easily, so rubbing a balloon on cotton produces little or no static charge.

This builds up static electricity, leaving each spoon with extra electrons (a negative charge) and the sweater with fewer (a positive charge). When one charged spoon is brought near a mixture of salt and pepper, the light, dry pepper flakes leap upward and stick to the spoon, while the heavier salt grains stay in the bowl. The sibling’s spoon, brought near only salt, doesn’t move anything. This shows that static electricity can pull more easily on very small, dry, lightweight pieces than on heavier or damp ones.
